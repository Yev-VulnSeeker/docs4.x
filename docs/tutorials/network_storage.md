## Introduction

Some GL.iNet models support TF card, some models have USB port and support USB flash drive and portable external hard drive, you can set up Samba, WebDAV, DLNA on this page for the disk.

The supported disk formats are NTFS, exFAT, FAT32, Ext3, Ext4.

## Insert storage device

For TF card, you need to power off the router first, insert the TF card and then power on the router.

For USB Drive, you can directly plug it into the USB port. For portable external hard drive, if you have a separate power supply, please connect it to the power supply.

Go to web Admin Panel -> APPLICATIONS -> Network Storage

## Set up Samba

Toggle to enable Samba, click **Apply**.

![network storage, enable samba](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/en/4/tutorials/network_storage/samba/samba_to_enable.png){class="glboxshadow"}

Go to **Shared Folder** tab. Click **+ Add** button to add a shared folder.

![network storage, shared folder](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/en/4/tutorials/network_storage/samba/samba_shared_folders.png){class="glboxshadow"}

Choose a folder to share, then click **Next**.

![network storage, shared folder](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/en/4/tutorials/network_storage/samba/samba_add_shared_folder.png){class="glboxshadow"}

For security reasons, we do not recommend enabling **Anonymous Access**.

If you leave the **Anonymous Access** off, you need to create a user by clicking the **+ Add User** button or choose an existing user, and then check the user in the option **Writable User** or **Read-Only User**. The User is for the connection to the Samba Server. You can manage the user in the **User Management** tab.

Finally, click the **Apply** button.

![network storage, shared folder](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/en/4/tutorials/network_storage/samba/samba_shared_folder_settings.png){class="glboxshadow"}

That is it. The access link can be found in **Shared Link**.

![network storage, shared link](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/en/4/tutorials/network_storage/samba/samba_shared_link.png){class="glboxshadow"}

Click **Shared Link**, it will show the access link for each system. The Unix-like system include Android, iOS, macOS, Ubuntu etc.

**Note:** If you enabled **Allow Access Samba from WAN** and access from WAN, you need to replace the Router IP (default 192.168.8.1) in the figure below with WAN IP which can be found in the INTERNET page.

![network storage, folder access link](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/en/4/tutorials/network_storage/samba/samba_folder_access_link.png){class="glboxshadow"}

Then try to access the Samba on various OS, check out [here](#samba-client).

## Set up WebDAV

Toggle to enable WebDAV.

For the protocol, **HTTP** is not encrypted, using on your risk; **HTTPS** is encrypted, it uses self signed certificate.

Then click **Apply**.

![network storage, enable webdav](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/en/4/tutorials/network_storage/webdav/enable_webdav.png){class="glboxshadow"}

Go to **Shared Folder** tab. Click **+ Add** button to add a shared folder.
