# MAC Clone

On the left side of web Admin Panel -> MORE SETTINGS -> MAC Clone

MAC Clone is useful when you connect to a public hotspot but you do not want the server to know your real MAC address or limit your Internet connections based on your MAC address.

You can clone to your current client's MAC or a random one.
