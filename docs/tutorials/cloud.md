### Select server region

At the first time when you sign in, it will pop up a dialog to let you select the region, please select the region same as your device selected Data Server on the web Admin Panel ([Step of enable GoodCloud on router](#enable-goodcloud-on-router)).

You can change the region on the top right corner at anytime.

![select region button](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/en/4/tutorials/cloud/select_region_button.png){class="glboxshadow"}

### Add a new group 

On the left side -> Groups List -> Add group.

Follow the steps below to add a new group.

![add group](https://static.gl-inet.com/goodcloud/docs/add-group.png){class="glboxshadow"}

Set the group name, company, description and location.

Each device must belong to a group.

### Add device

On the left side -> Devices List -> Add Device. There are three methods to bind device to your GoodCloud account, **Auto discover**, **Manually add** and **Bulk import**.

=== "Auto discover"

    If your router and PC(which opened GoodCloud website) are in the same network, please try the **Auto discover**.
    
    Follow the steps below to add your device.

    ![add device](https://static.gl-inet.com/goodcloud/docs/add-device.png){class="glboxshadow"}

    Check out [here](../where_to_find_the_device_id_mac_sn) to find the Device ID.

        Note: Input "DDNS/Device ID" here just to verify that the router is really 
        original/valid.

        If you haven't added a group before, it will automatically create a default 
        group.

    Click `Refresh` to force auto discover devices again.

    ![auto discover](https://static.gl-inet.com/goodcloud/docs/auto-discover.png){class="glboxshadow"}

=== "Manually add"

    If it can't discover automatically, try `Manually add`. All information that need to input can be found on the back of the router.

        Note: Input "MAC", "SN" and "DDNS" / "Device ID" here just to verify that the 
        router is really original and valid.

    For new models, it has **Device ID** on the back of router.

    ![manually add device](https://static.gl-inet.com/goodcloud/docs/manually-add-device-device-id.png){class="glboxshadow"}

    For old models, it has **DDNS** on the back of the router. Only the first 7 characters of **DDNS** are needed.

    ![manually add device](https://static.gl-inet.com/goodcloud/docs/manually-add-device.png){class="glboxshadow"}

=== "Bulk import"

    `Bulk import` is for user who have a great number of devices to add. By `Bulk import` you can import many devices by a Microsoft excel file.

### Bound info on router web Admin Panel

## Site to Site

### Introduction

Site to Site allows offices in multiple locations to establish secure connections with each other over internet. It extends the company's network, making computers resources from one location available to employees at other locations. 

<a href="https://static.gl-inet.com/www/images/solutions/s2s/s2s_main_5.png" target="_blank"><img alt="site to site diagram" src="https://static.gl-inet.com/www/images/solutions/s2s/s2s_main_5.png"></a>

Senerio 1: A company has dozens of branch offices that they wish to join in a single private network to share resources.

Senerio 2: A company has a close relationship with a partner company, the Site to Site allows the companies to work together in a secure, shared network environment.

Senerio 3: A family has IP camera and when they are not at home, the Site to Site allows to remote access the IP camera.

### Conditions

It requires at least two routers, each in a different location, one of which has a public IP address. Please [check if your ISP assigns you a public IP address](../how_to_check_if_isp_assigns_you_a_public_ip_address). It requires firmware version 3.026 and above.

Note: It is not recommended to run Site to Site while its nodes are also running VPN client, which can make the network particularly complex.

### Steps to build a Site to Site network

1. Bind your routers to GoodCloud. (<a href="#add-device">how?</a>)

2. Follow the steps below to create a Site to Site network.

    ![create a site to site network](https://static.gl-inet.com/goodcloud/docs/create-s2s-01.png){class="glboxshadow"}

    Default port is 51830, if you want to use another port, find the `Advanced` option at the lower left corner.

    Due to the device's performance, each Site to Site network can have up to 10 devices.

    After you had chosen the devices, click Continue.

    ![create a site to site network](https://static.gl-inet.com/goodcloud/docs/create-s2s-02.png){class="glboxshadow"}

    Then, it will test each device if it can be set as the Main Node of Site to Site.

    We suggest that the router with strong performance and best network speed to be the Main Node.

    ![testing each device](https://static.gl-inet.com/goodcloud/docs/testing-s2s-01.png){class="glboxshadow"}

    If none of the devices can be used as the Main Node, make sure that:

    - One of routers has a public IP, either static public IP or dynamic public IP.
    - Port is open, default is 51830.
    - If the router is behind NAT, you may need to set up port forwading.

    You can also change port and try again.

    ![testing each device](https://static.gl-inet.com/goodcloud/docs/testing-s2s-02.png){class="glboxshadow"}

    If there are more than one device can be set as the Main Node, you need to choose one to continue.

    ![testing each device](https://static.gl-inet.com/goodcloud/docs/testing-s2s-03.png){class="glboxshadow"}

    If there is only one device can be set as the Main Node, it will go to the Site to Site detail page directly.

    The network is stopped by default, check the LAN IP, if it is OK then you need to click Start button, otherwise click Setting to change LAN IP.

    ![detail s2s](https://static.gl-inet.com/goodcloud/docs/detail-s2s-00.png){class="glboxshadow"}

    Wait a few minutes, the node's connect status will display as lines. Solid line means connected, dashed line means disconnected.

    ![detail s2s](https://static.gl-inet.com/goodcloud/docs/detail-s2s-01.png){class="glboxshadow"}

### Testing the Site to Site connection

Now the Site to Site network is created and started, let's test the connection.

Use your PC or Phone to connect to one of the Node of this Site to Site, and use browser to access another Node's LAN ip, if you see the login page, the connection between these two nodes is worked.

For example, my PC connect to Node 1 device, and then I use browser to access Main Node's LAN IP (192.168.48.1), if I see the login page, it means the connection between Node1 and Main Node is worked.

### Route and other options

You can change each device's LAN IP and routes.

![LAN IP and routes](https://static.gl-inet.com/goodcloud/docs/lanip-routes-s2s.png){class="glboxshadow"}

By default, each node can access other's LAN, based on security, we recommend only open the corresponding service IPs.

E.g. There is a Server A(172.30.97.100) in Node 1's subnet, if you want other Site to Site nodes  only can access Node 1's Service A, you can set it like below:

![LAN IP and routes](https://static.gl-inet.com/goodcloud/docs/lanip-routes-s2s-02.png){class="glboxshadow"}

You can add node's parent routes too.

Each sub Node build an encrypted tunnel netwrok to Main Node, if you want to change the IP of tunnel subnet. Click 'IP Address Range'.

![Tunnel IP Address Range](https://static.gl-inet.com/goodcloud/docs/tunnel-ip-address-range-s2s.png){class="glboxshadow"}

## Batch Setting

You can use this feature to configure multiple parameters for a single device, or you can configure multiple parameters for multiple devices.

    Note: This feature is only available to business users.

### Batch Setting of Single Device

To configure single device, as show below.

  <a href="https://static.gl-inet.com/goodcloud/docs/modify_configuration.png" target="_blank"><img alt="Modify Configuration" src="https://static.gl-inet.com/goodcloud/docs/modify_configuration.png"></a>

The left side of image below is correct. If your interface is like the right side of image below, please upgrade to latest testing firmware.

  <a href="https://static.gl-inet.com/goodcloud/docs/single_configuration.png" target="_blank"><img alt="Single Configuration" src="https://static.gl-inet.com/goodcloud/docs/single_configuration.png"></a>

Check the configuration that needs to be modified and input value.
  
![Add Configuration](https://static.gl-inet.com/goodcloud/docs/add_configuration.png){class="glboxshadow"}

The checked configuration is required, and only the configuration that conforms to the rule can be filled out. After the configuration is delivered, it does not take effect immediately. The configuration takes effect and the device needs to be restarted. You can check the Restart now option in the lower right corner of the above figure. After the configuration is completed, the device will restart immediately.

Preview the configuration and confirm the delivery.

![Preview Configuration](https://static.gl-inet.com/goodcloud/docs/preview_configuration.png){class="glboxshadow"}

Unchecked **Restart now** option will prompt.

<a href="https://static.gl-inet.com/goodcloud/docs/config_not_take_effect.png" target="_blank"><img alt="config not take effect" src="https://static.gl-inet.com/goodcloud/docs/config_not_take_effect.png"></a>

### Batch Setting of Mutiple Devices

Select the devices you want to configure.

![mutiple configuration](https://static.gl-inet.com/goodcloud/docs/mutiple_configuration.png){class="glboxshadow" width="800"}

Other operations are the same as when operating a single device.

### Other Batch Operations

Other Batch Operations: Move to other group, upgrade, restart, delete.

![Task](https://static.gl-inet.com/goodcloud/docs/task.png){class="glboxshadow"}

## Template Management

Save frequently used configurations as templates and quickly apply them when you modify configurations in batches.

    Note: This feature is only available to business users.

### Add a Template

Check the configuration that needs to be modified and input value. Most of the options are the same as those on web Admin Panel.

![Add Template](https://static.gl-inet.com/goodcloud/docs/add_template.png){class="glboxshadow"}

#### Upgrade

**Upgrade Path** is for upgrading custom firmware. Put the firmware and a text file on a web server, then put the url path on the **Upgrade Path**. For example, [https://fw.gl-inet.com/firmware/ar750/v1/](https://fw.gl-inet.com/firmware/ar750/v1/) is a Upgrade Path, it has a **list-sha256.txt** file [https://fw.gl-inet.com/firmware/ar750/v1/list-sha256.txt](https://fw.gl-inet.com/firmware/ar750/v1/list-sha256.txt) and a corresponding firmware file [https://fw.gl-inet.com/firmware/ar750/v1/openwrt-ar750-3.203-0701.bin](https://fw.gl-inet.com/firmware/ar750/v1/openwrt-ar750-3.203-0701.bin).

    Note: GL-AX1800, GL-S1300, GL-B1300, GL-AP1300 only support http path for now.

![Template info](https://static.gl-inet.com/goodcloud/docs/template_upgrade_path.png){class="glboxshadow"}

The content of the text file is like [this](https://fw.gl-inet.com/firmware/ar750/v1/list-sha256.txt), its name should be **list-sha256.txt**. It has 4 columns, the first column is firmware version, the second column is the name of firmware file, the thrid column is the sha256 of firmware file, the forth column is the size of firmware file.

![gl-ar750 sha256](https://static.gl-inet.com/goodcloud/docs/ar750-sha256.png){class="glboxshadow"}

Give the template a name and description.

![Template info](https://static.gl-inet.com/goodcloud/docs/template_info.png){class="glboxshadow"}

You can view the execution result of each device and configuration.

![Task list detail info](https://static.gl-inet.com/goodcloud/docs/task_list_detail_info.png){class="glboxshadow"}

## GoodCloud and VPN

If you enable GoodCloud function and running VPN client at the same time on router, by default, the connection between the router and the GoodCloud server will also go through the VPN, but sometimes the VPN connection is unstable, or the VPN provider mistakenly filters the GoodCloud connection, you can make the GoodCloud connection not go through the VPN by using the following settings.

Go to web Admin Panel, on the left side, VPN -> VPN Dashboard -> VPN Client -> Global Options.

![Services from GL.iNet doesn't Use VPN](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/en/4/tutorials/cloud/goodcloud_donot_use_vpn.png){class="glboxshadow"}

It is not recommended to run Site to Site while its nodes are also running VPN client, which can make the network particularly complex.

## Turn off cloud

To stop GoodCloud service, turn it off on router web Admin Panel. Please follow the steps below. No action needed on the GoodCloud website.

![disable cloud](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/en/4/tutorials/cloud/turn_off_cloud.png){class="glboxshadow"}

After disable Cloud, the interface is like below.

![after disable cloud](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/en/4/tutorials/cloud/after_turn_off_cloud.png){class="glboxshadow"}
