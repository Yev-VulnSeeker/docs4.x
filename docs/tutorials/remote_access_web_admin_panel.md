# How to remote access the web Admin Panel of GL.iNet router?

- **Method 1**: If your router's network has a [public IP](../how_to_check_if_isp_assigns_you_a_public_ip_address), please set up a [WireGuard Server](../wireguard_server) and use WireGuard to access the router's web Admin Panel. If you don't have a public IP, please try methods 2 and 3.
- **Method 2**: Please [bind your device to GoodCloud](../cloud/#setup), then you can [access the router's web Admin Panel remotely](../cloud/#remote-access-web-admin-panel) by logging into the [GoodCloud website](https://www.goodcloud.xyz){target="_blank"}.
