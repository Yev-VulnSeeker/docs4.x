On the left side of web Admin Panel -> NETWORK -> DNS

If you set custom DNS servers, any dns name will be resolved through the DNS servers set here instead of the one obtained from wan, repeater, cellular, hotspot sharing or VPN configuration DNS server.

**DNS Rebinding Attack Protection:** Turning on this option may cause private DNS lookup failure. If your network has a captive portal please disable this option.

**Override DNS Settings for All Clients:** If enabled, your router will override unencrypted DNS settings for all clients.

## DNS Server Settings

There are four modes.

- Automatic, use the gateway of the parent router.
