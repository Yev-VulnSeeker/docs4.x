# MAC Address

On the left side of web Admin Panel -> NETWORK -> MAC Address

The MAC Address page was previously called MAC Clone and has been changed to MAC Address since v4.2.

On this page, you can find the router's default MAC address, clone a client's MAC address, enter a MAC address manually, or generate a random MAC address.

* The factory default MAC address.

* Clone a client's MAC address.

    **Note:** Many new devices now use a different random MAC address to connect to different WiFi, so the MAC address shown here may not be the actual MAC address of the user's device. The randomized MAC may also be called a Private Wi-Fi Address or a random hardware address on different devices. 

* Manual input or generate a random MAC address.

## Usage Scenarios

When you connect to a public hotspot, use a random MAC address if you do not want the hotspot to know your real MAC address or to limit your access to the Internet based on it. Please read this guide [Connect to a Hotspot with a Captive Portal](../faq/connect_to_a_hotspot_with_captive_portal.md).
