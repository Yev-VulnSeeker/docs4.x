## LAN

The LAN is the network if your devices connect to the Main WiFi or connect via an ethernet cable.

The **Router IP Address** is **192.168.8.1** by default. You can change it if it conflicts with your network.

### Security Settings

**Client Isolation**: You can isolate your network's client devices into a separate network area.These devices cannot communicate with other devices or with each other on the network.

## DHCP Server

The **DHCP Server** is enabled by default.The DHCP server automatically assigning IP addresses and other communication parameters to each client devices.If the DHCP server is disabled, you will have to configure them manually for each client.

You can change the starting and ending IP addresses to suit your needs, for example, if the size of the network expands or shrinks, if there are IP address conflicts in the network, or if the subnet mask or IP address range has changed.

## Address Reservation

When you specify a reserved IP address for a client within the LAN, the client always receives the same IP address each time it accesses the routerâ€™s DHCP server. You can assign reserved IP addresses to computers or servers that require permanent IP settings.

**Note:** Configured clients have to reconnect the router to activate.

Click **Add** to reserve an IP.
